## About the project: 
Welcome to the Pet Advisor project. This is a project made for the CodeX Web Development challenge. The theme selected by our team is PETS. 
According to Gfk, a global research firm, more than 56% of the world's population has atleast one pet in their household. Despite this staggering number, pet owners still find difficulties in terms of pet management. Our website aims to tackle a few of these problems. 
The website has many features like a vaccine diary, a name picker, resources, and maps  to help current and future pet-owners
