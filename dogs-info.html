        <div class="animal">Dogs</div>
        They have been bred by humans for a long time, and
        probably were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
        Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to
        help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because
        they are usually playful, friendly, and listen to humans
        They are fast, energetic and good sports companions. They
        normally have a life span of 10-13 years but some breeds
        can live up to 20 years too.

        <div class="animal">Yorkshire terrier</div>
        Tiny but full of personality, these dogs are popular
        world over. They are affectionate family dogs that
        are happy to play and run around with children, or
        cuddle up with family members. Originating from
        rainy Yorkshire in England, these dogs do
        surprisingly well in warmer climates, perhaps due
        to their silky fur. Their small size also makes them
        great apartment dogs, though they can be difficult
        to housetrain and their yappy nature may annoy
        your neighbours – take time to train your dog
        from an early stage to avoid these problems.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Havanese</div>
        Affectionate yet agile, the Havanese is a versatile
        dog breed, which may explain its popularity.
        Originating from Cuba, these little dogs have silky
        coats that help shield them from the sun, which
        makes them ideal dogs for the Middle East. They
        adapt easily to apartment life due to their small
        size. They are affectionate, though they may suffer
        from separation anxiety. Don’t mistake the
        Havanese for a mere lapdog – they are very agile
        and intelligent, and excel in many canine sports
        and careers, such as assisting the handicapped.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</div>
        Small, sweet-tempered and sporty, the Cavalier is
        one of the most popular dogs in the world. These
        beautiful, energetic and gentle dogs are ideal for
        families, and are very trainable. Cavaliers
        sometimes suffer from separation anxiety, so
        shouldn’t be left alone for long time periods. They
        also need daily exercise to keep them fit and
        prevent them from becoming bored, as a bored
        Cavalier may be destructive. Make sure not to
        take them out during the hottest hours of the day,
        as Cavaliers don’t always do well in hot climates.

        <div class="animal">German Shepherds</div>
        The German Shepherd is a popular pet in Dubai,
        though they are also used as guard dogs.
        Shepherds are large, intelligent dogs and are easily
        trained. They are also very versatile and have been
        used for herding, agility, police work, guide dog
        work, and many other disciplines. Although they
        often have reserved characters, they are very loyal
        dogs and make good family pets. German Shepherds
        needs to be socialised and trained from an early
        age to make sure they grow up to be well behaved dogs.
        Due to their large size, they may not be the best
        apartment dogs. They also need regular daily exercise:
        both physical and mental.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Cane Corso</div>
        Also called the Italian Mastiff, these dogs
        are often used as guard dogs due to their
        powerful and muscular build. They are also
        loyal family dogs, though often uninterested
        or suspicious of strangers. The Corso hails
        from Italy, so they cope well with the Dubai
        heat. The Corso gets bored very easily. A
        bored Corso will probably dig holes and chew
        the furniture if given nothing to do, so find
        an activity for him to do, such as agility or
        obedience classes. An active Cane Corso is a
        happy Corso.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Golden Retriever</div>
        The Retriever is perhaps the quintessential family dog.
        Cheerful, trustworthy, and playful, this dog is
        universally beloved. They are great with children and
        other pets, intelligent and eager to please, and ideal
        for first-time dog owners. Retrievers are large dogs
        and prone to shedding, so they will be happier in a
        house than an apartment. Be sure to find a reputable
        Breeder, as Golden Retrievers are prone to health
        problems such as hip dysplasia.

        <div class="animal">Great Dane</div>
        Dubai is the city of superlatives: the richest,
        the hottest, the biggest. The Great Dane
        certainly fits into that last category, and
        often appeals to those who wish to impress.
        The Great Dane is a typical gentle giant: their
        size belies their friendly nature. Great Danes
        aren’t particularly active and are surprisingly
        comfortable in apartments, although they may
        accidentally knock things over due to their size.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Pomeranian</div>
        From the largest dogs to one of the smallest,
        here’s the Pomeranian. Don’t tell the Pomeranian
        what he can and can’t do, because these little
        dogs are very determined and are often on par
        with bigger dogs in disciplines such as agility,
        search and rescue, and obedience training. These
        little dogs will be happy to live in an apartment
        but don’t enjoy the heat of Dubai due to their
        fluffy coats; luckily air conditioning helps to
        keep them comfortable.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Beagle</div>
        A short-furred breed with large soulful eyes,
        Beagles are playful and friendly, and popular
        all over the world. They make fantastic pets,
        especially for families with children, and are
        very intelligent, if a bit stubborn. Beagles
        have a few quirky behaviours, such as the baying
        sounds they make when they are lonely or smell
        something interesting, which is important to keep
        in mind if you lived in an apartment.
