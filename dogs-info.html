<div class="dogs">Dogs</div>
<p>
    <div class="landing-text"> They have been bred by humans for a long time, and    
    probably were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
     Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to
  help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because
 they are usually playful, friendly, and listen to humans
     They are fast, energetic and good sports companions. They
   normally have a life span of 10-13 years but some breeds
    can live up to 20 years too.</div>

<div class="dogs">Yorkshire terrier</div>
<p>
    <div class="landing-text"> Tiny but full of personality, these dogs are popular    
     world over. They are affectionate family dogs that
     are happy to play and run around with children, or
     cuddle up with family members. Originating from
     rainy Yorkshire in England, these dogs do
     surprisingly well in warmer climates, perhaps due
     to their silky fur. Their small size also makes them
     great apartment dogs, though they can be difficult 
     to housetrain and their yappy nature may annoy
     your neighbours – take time to train your dog
     from an early stage to avoid these problems.</div>

<div class="dogs">Havanese</div>
<p>
    <div class="landing-text"> Affectionate yet agile, the Havanese is a versatile   
     dog breed, which may explain its popularity. 
     Originating from Cuba, these little dogs have silky
     coats that help shield them from the sun, which
     makes them ideal dogs for the Middle East. They
     adapt easily to apartment life due to their small
     size. They are affectionate, though they may suffer
     from separation anxiety. Don’t mistake the  
     Havanese for a mere lapdog – they are very agile
     and intelligent, and excel in many canine sports
     and careers, such as assisting the handicapped.</div>

<div class="dogs">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</div>
<p>
    <div class="landing-text"> Small, sweet-tempered and sporty, the Cavalier is   
    one of the most popular dogs in the world. These  
    beautiful, energetic and gentle dogs are ideal for
    families, and are very trainable. Cavaliers
    sometimes suffer from separation anxiety, so 
    shouldn’t be left alone for long time periods. They
    also need daily exercise to keep them fit and
    prevent them from becoming bored, as a bored 
    Cavalier may be destructive. Make sure not to
    take them out during the hottest hours of the day,
    as Cavaliers don’t always do well in hot climates.</div>
