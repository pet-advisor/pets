    Only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is 
    often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it 
    from the wild members of the family. Cats spend between 
    30 to 50 percent of their day grooming themselves. The 
    ridged pattern on cat’s nose is as unique as a human 
    fingerprint. They have a life span of 12-18 years.</div>

    <div class="landing-text">  
     A long-haired breed of cat characterized by 
     its round face and short muzzle. Persian cat 
     is also known as "furniture with fur" because 
     of its lazy nature and ability to remain 
     motionless for hours. It is called "Persian" 
     because it was exported from Iran, or ancient 
     Persia. Persians might look prissy and aloof, 
     but they’re actually considered to be one of 
     the most low-maintenance and friendliest cat breeds.</div>

    <div class="landing-text"> The German Shepherd is a popular pet in Dubai,   
     though they are also used as guard dogs.   
     A breed of domestic cat, with ears that 
     fold bending forward and down towards 
     the front of the head. They are also 
     known for sitting with their legs 
     stretched out and their paws on their 
     belly. This position is called the 
     "Buddha Position". Unlike many other 
     cats, Scottish Fold likes to sleep on 
     its back. They have a life span of 9 to 
     12 years.</div>

     A breed of domestic cat that has M-shaped 
     dark markings on the forehead, two black 
     lines on cheeks and dark bands on the tail. 
     The most important recognizable "traits" of 
     this particular animal is a long, dark, 
     dorsal stripe that runs from its head to its 
     tail along its spine. It is the only 
     domesticated cat with a naturally occurring 
     spotted coat. It ranks as one of the most 
     athletic and agile cat breeds. They have a

     A breed of short-haired cat, known for its 
     slender body, wavy coat, and large ears. They 
     are a very intelligent breed; the typical Devon 
     Rex can be trained to walk on a leash, fetch or 
     perform all manner of tricks usually associated 
     with canines, like jump, heel. Unlike most cats, 
     their whiskers are very short and often curled to 
     such an extent that it may appear as if they have 
     no whiskers. Devons, which are medium-sized cats, 
     are often called "pixie cats" or "alien cats" 
     because of their unique appearance.</div>

    <div class="landing-text">
     Hundreds of years ago, Siamese cats were 
     treasured by royal families in Thailand 
     because of their distinctive, unusual, and 
     beautiful appearances. The Siamese cat comes 
     in two distinct variations: traditional, with
      an apple-shaped head and a slightly chubby 
      body; or the modern Siamese, which are very 
      skinny and have a wedge-shaped head. All 
      Siamese kittens, although pure cream or white 
      at birth, develop visible points in the first 
      few months of life in colder parts of their body.</div>

     A long-haired, color-pointed cat with a broad face 
     and a distinct Roman nose. It was said that they 
     were given their luxurious coat and stunningly blue 
     eyes as a reward from a goddess due to their 
     dedication and loyalty to a priest.  Their coat color
    is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white, 
    symmetrical "gloves" on each paw that are the trademark 
    of the breed.</div>

     ancient Egyptian culture, as it occurs in 
     paintings and as bronze figurines. It can leap 
     higher than 4 meters (12 ft) and catch birds in 
     midair. Their extraordinary ears each have over

     race car and stay low on the ground to get enough
