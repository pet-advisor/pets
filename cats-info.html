        <div class="animal">Cats</div>
        Only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is
        often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it
        from the wild members of the family. Cats spend between
        30 to 50 percent of their day grooming themselves. The
        ridged pattern on cat’s nose is as unique as a human
        fingerprint. They have a life span of 12-18 years.

        <div class="animal">Maine Coon</div>
        Largest domesticated cat breed which has a distinctive
        physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. It is
        characterized by a prominent ruff along its chest,
        robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an
        uneven two-layered coat with longer guard hairs over a
        silky satin undercoat. It is one of the oldest natural
        breeds in North America, specifically native to the US
        state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.

        <div class="animal">Persian Cat</div>
        A long-haired breed of cat characterized by
        its round face and short muzzle. Persian cat
        is also known as "furniture with fur" because
        of its lazy nature and ability to remain
        motionless for hours. It is called "Persian"
        because it was exported from Iran, or ancient
        Persia. Persians might look prissy and aloof,
        but they’re actually considered to be one of
        the most low-maintenance and friendliest cat breeds.

        <div class="animal">British Shorthair</div>
        The British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-
        looking large cat, having a broad chest, strong
        thick-set legs with rounded paws and a medium-
        length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively
        large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks
        and large round eyes that are deep coppery orange in
        the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending
        on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set

        <div class="animal">Scottish Fold</div>
        The German Shepherd is a popular pet in Dubai,
        though they are also used as guard dogs.
        A breed of domestic cat, with ears that
        fold bending forward and down towards
        the front of the head. They are also
        known for sitting with their legs
        stretched out and their paws on their
        belly. This position is called the
        "Buddha Position". Unlike many other
        cats, Scottish Fold likes to sleep on
        its back. They have a life span of 9 to
        12 years.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Egyptian Mau</div>
        A breed of domestic cat that has M-shaped
        dark markings on the forehead, two black
        lines on cheeks and dark bands on the tail.
        The most important recognizable "traits" of
        this particular animal is a long, dark,
        dorsal stripe that runs from its head to its
        tail along its spine. It is the only
        domesticated cat with a naturally occurring
        spotted coat. It ranks as one of the most
        athletic and agile cat breeds. They have a
        life span of 12-15 years.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Devon Rex</div>
        A breed of short-haired cat, known for its
        slender body, wavy coat, and large ears. They
        are a very intelligent breed; the typical Devon
        Rex can be trained to walk on a leash, fetch or
        perform all manner of tricks usually associated
        with canines, like jump, heel. Unlike most cats,
        their whiskers are very short and often curled to
        such an extent that it may appear as if they have
        no whiskers. Devons, which are medium-sized cats,
        are often called "pixie cats" or "alien cats"
        because of their unique appearance.

        <div class="animal">Siamese</div>
        Hundreds of years ago, Siamese cats were
        treasured by royal families in Thailand
        because of their distinctive, unusual, and
        beautiful appearances. The Siamese cat comes
        in two distinct variations: traditional, with
        an apple-shaped head and a slightly chubby
        body; or the modern Siamese, which are very
        skinny and have a wedge-shaped head. All
        Siamese kittens, although pure cream or white
        at birth, develop visible points in the first
        few months of life in colder parts of their body.

        <div class="animal">Birman</div>
        A long-haired, color-pointed cat with a broad face
        and a distinct Roman nose. It was said that they
        were given their luxurious coat and stunningly blue
        eyes as a reward from a goddess due to their
        dedication and loyalty to a priest. Their coat color
        is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white,
        symmetrical "gloves" on each paw that are the trademark
        of the breed.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Carcal</div>
        A slender, moderately sized cat characterized
        by a robust build, a short face, long canine
        teeth, tufted ears, and long legs. They appear
        to have been religiously significant in the
        ancient Egyptian culture, as it occurs in
        paintings and as bronze figurines. It can leap
        higher than 4 meters (12 ft) and catch birds in
        midair. Their extraordinary ears each have over
        20 muscles that swivel around like satellite
        dishes to detect sounds of their prey.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Munchkin</div>
        A small to medium-sized cat characterized by its
        very short legs, with a moderate body type and
        medium-plush coat. They have a lot of energy for
        speed and agility and can turn corners like a furry
        race car and stay low on the ground to get enough
        traction. Munchkins are frequently found sitting
        up on their hind legs like a rabbit in order to get
        a better glimpse of something that has caught their eye.

        <div class="animal">Bengal Cat</div>
        A domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of
        domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau,
        with the Asian leopard cat. It is the Rolls Royce of
        cat world. Bengals are larger than the average house
        cat because of their muscular bodies. They are an
        energetic breed which needs much exercise and play.

        <div class="animal">Ragdoll</div>
        A large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a color
        point coat and blue eyes. They are one of the largest
        domesticated cat breeds, with a sturdy body, large
        frame, and proportionate legs. The genes for point
        coloration are responsible for the distinctive blue
        eyes of the Ragdoll.
