        If you’re a pet parent, then you know that our furry friends are just as much a part of the family as everyone
        else. Whether you are a doting dog owner or have a feline friend in the house, it’s essential to know which
        residential areas in UAE are best suited for you and your furry companion. To help you pick the right home,
        we’ve compiled a list of the top pet-friendly communities in UAE. <br>

        the neighbourhood is still great for small pet owners as it houses plenty of grassy areas, along with a handful
        of pet-friendly cafes and restaurants. There are several pet-grooming centres in the neighbourhood as well to
        bring your furry friend in for some pampering.
