            <div class="animal">Birds</div>
            Birds make for good pets. They require less immediate care
            than cats or dogs. They are inexpensive to feed, social and affectionate. And, they don't require large
            habitats. They are also relatively easier to train.<br><br>
            Given proper training and socialization, birds can be every bit as loving and affectionate as a cat or dog.
            Some
            pet birds are inseparable from their owners. <br>

            <div class="animal">Budgerigar</div>
            A small green and yellow parrot, with black barring
            above, and a small patch of blue on the cheek.
            Budgerigars have tetrachromatic color vision,
            although all four classes of cone cells will not
            operate simultaneously unless under sunlight or a UV
            lamp. They are the third most popular pet in the world,
            after the domesticated dog and cat.

            <div class="animal">Cockatiel</div>
            A small parrot that has grey plumage with
            prominent white flashes on the outer edges
            of each wing. They have also learned to
            imitate certain human or environmental sounds
            without being taught how to do so. The
            cockatiel's distinctive erectile crest expresses
            the animal's emotional state. They feature a round
            orange area on both ears, often referred to as
            "cheddar cheeks".

            <div class="animal">Cockatoo</div>
            If you prefer a large pet bird that is friendly
            and affectionate, a cockatoo can be a great choice.
            These beautiful birds bond very strongly with their
            caretakers and prefer to be with them as often as
            possible. It is imperative that you have plenty of
            time to spend socializing with your bird. Cockatoos
            can become depressed if they aren't given enough
            attention and might resort to feather plucking or
            other destructive behaviors.

            <div class="animal">Hyacinth Macaw</div>
            Known as "gentle giants," hyacinth macaws
            are the largest of all parrots. And as
            sociable and friendly birds, they love nothing
            more than to spend time playing and cuddling
            with their owners. Due to their size, it can be
            difficult for most people to provide proper
            housing for these birds. But those who are able
            to meet their needs are rewarded with an incredible
            relationship with their feathered friend.

            <div class="animal">Agapornis</div>
            Lovebirds are social and affectionate small
            parrot. Their name comes from parrot’s strong
            monogamous pair bonding long period of
            spending sitting and grooming each other.
            Lovebirds are the smallest species of parrot
            with a length of just 13 to 17cm and weight
            only 40 to 60 grams, stocky built, short tail
            and large sharp beak.

            <div class="animal">Dove</div>
            You might not immediately think of a dove as a friendly pet bird, but domesticated, hand-fed doves are known
            to
            be extremely sweet and gentle. These birds rarely bite, and even people with limited bird experience
            generally
            find it easy to train and bond with doves. They enjoy their caretakers' companionship but usually won’t be
            overly demanding of attention.

            <div class="animal">Parrotlet</div>
            Spunky and relatively easy to care for, parrotlets are known for having personalities much larger than their
            tiny bodies. Those considering parrotlets must have plenty of time to play and socialize with their pets, as
            these birds can become a little wild without regular handling. But people who interact with their parrotlets
            every day are usually able to form strong bonds with these comical little birds.

            <div class="animal">Green Cheecked Conure</div>
            Hailing from South America, green-cheeked conures thrive on spending time socializing
            with their caretakers. By nature, they are intelligent, playful, and slightly mischievous birds. But
            compared to
            other conure species, they tend to be quieter and more easygoing. They usually don’t learn to talk, but
            their
            charming personalities are more than enough to make them entertaining and engaging companions.

            <div class="animal">Hawn's Macaw</div>
            Also native to South America, Hahn’s macaws are the smallest macaws. But they pack a lot
            of personality into their compact bodies. They are intelligent and playful birds that tend to be gentle when
            properly socialized and handled. These macaws prefer to spend as much time interacting with their caretakers
            as
            possible and might become depressed if they feel ignored. They also can be rather noisy, though some do
            learn to
            talk quite well.
