    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Budgerigar</div>
        A small green and yellow parrot, with black barring
        above, and a small patch of blue on the cheek.
        Budgerigars have tetrachromatic color vision,
        although all four classes of cone cells will not
        operate simultaneously unless under sunlight or a UV
        lamp. They are the third most popular pet in the world,
        after the domesticated dog and cat.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Cockatiel</div>
        A small parrot that has grey plumage with
        prominent white flashes on the outer edges
        of each wing. They have also learned to
        imitate certain human or environmental sounds
        without being taught how to do so. The
        cockatiel's distinctive erectile crest expresses
        the animal's emotional state. They feature a round
        orange area on both ears, often referred to as
        "cheddar cheeks".

        <div class="animal">Cockatoo</div>
        If you prefer a large pet bird that is friendly
        and affectionate, a cockatoo can be a great choice.
        These beautiful birds bond very strongly with their
        caretakers and prefer to be with them as often as
        possible. It is imperative that you have plenty of
        time to spend socializing with your bird. Cockatoos
        can become depressed if they aren't given enough
        attention and might resort to feather plucking or
        other destructive behaviors.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Hyacinth Macaw</div>
        Known as "gentle giants," hyacinth macaws
        are the largest of all parrots. And as
        sociable and friendly birds, they love nothing
        more than to spend time playing and cuddling
        with their owners. Due to their size, it can be
        difficult for most people to provide proper
        housing for these birds. But those who are able
        to meet their needs are rewarded with an incredible
        relationship with their feathered friend.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Agapornis</div>
        Lovebirds are social and affectionate small
        parrot. Their name comes from parrot’s strong
        monogamous pair bonding long period of
        spending sitting and grooming each other.
        Lovebirds are the smallest species of parrot
        with a length of just 13 to 17cm and weight

        <div class="animal">Dove</div>
        You might not immediately think of a dove as a friendly pet bird, but domesticated, hand-fed doves are known to
        be extremely sweet and gentle. These birds rarely bite, and even people with limited bird experience generally
        find it easy to train and bond with doves. They enjoy their caretakers' companionship but usually won’t be
        overly demanding of attention.

    <div class="landing-text">
        <div class="animal">Parrotlet</div>
        Spunky and relatively easy to care for, parrotlets are known for having personalities much larger than their
        tiny bodies. Those considering parrotlets must have plenty of time to play and socialize with their pets, as
        these birds can become a little wild without regular handling. But people who interact with their parrotlets
        every day are usually able to form strong bonds with these comical little birds.

        <div class="animal">Green Cheecked Conure</div>
        Hailing from South America, green-cheeked conures thrive on spending time socializing
        with their caretakers. By nature, they are intelligent, playful, and slightly mischievous birds. But compared to
        other conure species, they tend to be quieter and more easygoing. They usually don’t learn to talk, but their
        charming personalities are more than enough to make them entertaining and engaging companions.

        <div class="animal">Hawn's Macaw</div>
        Also native to South America, Hahn’s macaws are the smallest macaws. But they pack a lot
        of personality into their compact bodies. They are intelligent and playful birds that tend to be gentle when
        properly socialized and handled. These macaws prefer to spend as much time interacting with their caretakers as
        possible and might become depressed if they feel ignored. They also can be rather noisy, though some do learn to
        talk quite well.
